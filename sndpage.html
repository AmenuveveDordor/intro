        <u>INSIGHT INTO NATURE'S WONDERS</u>
    </h3>
    <p>
        My home region, the volta region, boasts of many tourist attractions from Mount Afadja close to the villages of Liati Wote and Gbledi Gbogame to the Adomi bridge situated magnificently across the River Volta not forgetting other sites like the Fort Prinzenstein in Keta and so on.
        However, the focus for this page is the great Mount Afadja

    <h3>
       <u> THE GREAT MOUNT AFADJA </u> 
    </h3>
    <p>
        Mount Afadja, known as Afadjato to the Ewe people of Ghana and Togo, is the highest mountain in Ghana. The summit is located in the Volta Region, near the border with Togo, close to the villages of Liati Wote and Gbledi Gbogame in the Afadjato South District and Hohoe Municipality, respectively. It is about 178 kilometers northeast of Accra, and 178 kilometers northwest of Lom√©. Part of the Agumatsa sub-range of the West Africa Mountains, its summit is 885 metres above sea level. The summit of Mount Aduadu lies 3.5 kilometers to the east. The mountain's name is "Afadja," while the suffix "-to" in the Ewe language means mountain. The correct name in the English language, therefore, would be "Mount Afadja", as "Mount Afadjato" would be a repetition of the word "mountain". When the Ewe people migrated to the area and saw the mountain, it looked like the mound in which water yam is planted, water yam being called "Avadze" in Ewe. Moreover, there were some creeping plants on the mountain that resembled the water yam plant; they therefore called it "Avadze-to". Today the word has been palatalized into "Afadjato".
